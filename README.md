CO510  Modelling Assessment: UML Portfolio 3 (Sequence Diagrams)
Set by:  Rog√©rio de Lemos 

Set on: Monday, Week the 9 (18/11/2019)

Due in: Thursday, Week 12 (12/12/2019) @ 23:55

Submission (individual): Moodle



The CO510 terminal sessions exercises for weeks 4 to 9 will be part of your coursework that will be assessed, and this should be an individual effort. 



This modelling assessment is to be submitted in three parts, and each part has a different submission link on Moodle. The modelling assessment will be marked after the submission of the final part, which may include revised versions of the other two submissions. However, the original submissions related to the other parts may influence the final mark. For each part of the portfolio, late or non submissions will be penalised accordingly. 



For this CO510 Modelling Assessment (UML Portfolio 3) we will be looking into UML sequence diagrams.



Creating a Papyrus Project and UML Models
In the following, we present the steps you can follow for creating a new UML class diagram when creating a new Papyrus Model inside the existing Papyrus Project. 


Steps for creating a project and a UML model:

Work on the same Papyrus Project that you have created for the UML use case and sequence diagrams.
Inside that same Papyrus Project, create a new Papyrus Model. The Diagram Language should be UML. Next.
Make sure that Parent Folder is [yourlogin]_TaxiCumulus. Under File name enter the name of your model name [yourlogin]_Portfolio3. Next.
Under Root model element name enter [yourlogin]_Portfolio3.  Select Sequence Diagram (in case you would to prepare the UML Sequence diagram in Papyrys). Finish.
Once a Papyrus Project has been defined, there is no need to create other Papyrus projects. For each UML portfolio, a new Papyrus model should be created.



Problem Description - TaxiCumulus
Consider a new app (TaxiCumulus) to be developed for the Sky Taxi Company, with headquarters at Canterbury, that would allow its premium customers to manage their own bookings regarding trips to and from London airports. With this very simple app, the taxi company expects their premium customers to be able to manage their own bookings instead of contacting the company. 



The customers access the app for browsing the services and the tariffs provided by the taxi company, while premium customers access services by using third party authentication service, such as, Facebook or Google. Once authenticated, premium customers should be able to browse the diary of the Sky Taxi Company to check for availability. They should be able to make bookings, amend bookings, and cancel bookings. It is expected for each transaction a confirmation to be sent to the customer. Every booking needs to be paid before a confirmation is sent, and amendments and cancellations also require a fee to be paid. Any payment can be done either via credit/debit card or bank transfer. During periods of low demand the taxi company offers discounts to its customers for new bookings. A new service that the taxi company also provides is the ability for customers to share trips to and from airports in order to reduce costs. This involves customers interacting between themselves through a forum in order to negotiate times for their trips, the taxi company doesn't involve itself in any interaction between customers arranging shared trips.



In addition to the above description of the TaxiCumulus app, you need to consider the following details when design the app. Each premium customer needs to provide one address, but can include up to 5 alternative addresses, and whether he/she is part of an organisation. Moreover, each premium customer is allowed 5 bookings at most. The information related to a booking should include the information related to a premium customer making the booking, a pickup and destination addresses, the date and time of the booking, the fee, and a reference number. As mentioned above, consider also that the premium customer can authenticate either using Facebook or Google, and that the payments can be done either via credit/debit card or bank transfer. The database keeps a record of premium customers, bookings and organisations, and for the purpose of this exercise you do not need to represent the operations on the attributes of the database. For the payment, banks are identified by the bank name, sort code and account number, and credit card are identified by card number, expire date of the card, and name and address of the owner of the card. 



Assignment
Based on the above problem description, you are asked to provide:

Based on the UML use case diagram of Portfolio 1, specify a UML sequence diagram representing the use case that captures the sequence of actions related to cancelling a booking (or similar use case in your diagram that captures this service).
Based on the UML class diagram of Portfolio 2, specify a UML sequence diagram representing a premium customer cancelling a booking.
Check whether the UML sequence diagram of the design (UML class diagram) conforms with the UML sequence diagram of the requirements (UML use case diagram). In a 200 words, explain the conformance (or not) of your UML sequence diagram for UML class diagram against the UML sequence diagram for the UML use case diagram. 
All the above three parts should be submitted as a single PDF file. You can either use pen and paper, or any other drawing or modelling tool. Example of tools that you may use are  WebSequenceDiagrams or sequencediagram.org. In case it is needed, in order to accommodate the behaviours from UML Portfolio 3, you can modify your UML class diagram to be submitted under UML Portfolio 2.



Submission
For UML Portfolio 3, you should submit via Moodle your solution consisting of a PDF file containing the two sequence diagrams requested above, together with the 200 words explaining the conformance (or not) of your UML sequence diagram for UML class diagram against the UML sequence diagram for the UML use case diagram. 


NOTE: As a submission, for your Papyrus UML diagrams nothing else will be accepted except for an archive (.zip) file of your Papyrus Project. It is your responsibility to make sure that the file is not empty or corrupted.



Late Submission and Plagiarism
Late or non submission of coursework
The penalty for late or non submission of coursework is normally that a mark of zero is awarded for the missing piece of work and the final mark for the module is calculated accordingly. 
Plagiarism and Duplication of Material
Senate has agreed the following definition of plagiarism: "Plagiarism is the act of repeating the ideas or discoveries of another as one's own. To copy sentences, phrases or even striking expressions without acknowledgment in a manner that may deceive the reader as to the source is plagiarism; to paraphrase in a manner that may deceive the reader is likewise plagiarism. Where such copying or close paraphrase has occurred the mere mention of the source in a bibliography will not be deemed sufficient acknowledgment; in each such instance it must be referred specifically to its source. Verbatim quotations must be directly acknowledged either in inverted commas or by indenting." The work you submit must be your own, except where its original author is clearly referenced. We reserve the right to run checks on all submitted work in an effort to identify possible plagiarism, and take disciplinary action against anyone found to have committed plagiarism. When you use other peoples' material, you must clearly indicate the source of the material using the Harvard style (see http://www.kent.ac.uk/uelt/ai/styleguides.html).
In addition, substantial amounts of verbatim or near verbatim cut-and-paste from web-based sources, course material and other resources will not be considered as evidence of your own understanding of the topics being examined.
The School publishes an on-line Plagiarism and Collaboration Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) which is available at:

Work may be submitted to Turnitin for the identification of possible plagiarism. You can find out more about Turnitin at the following page: https://www.kent.ac.uk/elearning/turnitin/.
